# React - Weather App

To run the app you will need to generate an API key on [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). Now you need to duplicate the file `.env.example`, rename to `.env` and insert the generated token as value for the key `REACT_APP_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY`. Now you are ready to run the project.

## Available Scripts

#### `npm install`

Install dependecies.

#### `npm run start`
